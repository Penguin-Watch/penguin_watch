*spatial patterns in BS - do close sights have similar BS (CUVE and GEOR)? 
    -If not, may have to do with sight layout (precip)
    -Get average season precip at sites and compare to BS
    -Quantify precip events in images and look at relationship to timing of nest failure
    -Mention re-lay after storm events at BROW
    -plot output vs KRILL and SIC
*compare BS to population sizes (maybe number of GEPE in area from ASI data)
*link between timing of breeding failure (from timing model) and BS
    -add precip events into model
*fit model using only end of season data - no time varying detection parameter
    -compare estimates with hand estimates



TODO
-Split by half days rather than full days
-Make sure chicks are seen before start
-Make sure stopping point at correct place
-Fit model with covariates



paper points (MEPS?):
*differences in BS across space
*timing of breeding failure - at egg stage and at precip events
*total number of precip events to BS
*total precip from reanalysis to BS
*substrate differences - nesting on tussock mounds and on peat means that penguins in SG don't really get wet, even after precip events
